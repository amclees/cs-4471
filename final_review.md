## Schedule

9:30am on 5/19/2018

## Material

Chapter 11 to 22

It is **not** cumulative

There is a troubleshooting IPv6 and VLAN chapter, chapter 20, will have only
one multiple choice 1.5 point question. The problem will be a connection issue
example with us asked to identify the problem

In chapter 22, there is QoS at the end. It is not on the exam.

Some short answer questions, the answer is only **one word**

## Question Types

Most questions are made by the professor, but some are from the review in the
textbook.

Reading and reviewing slides is recommended for studying. If you understand all
slides, you will be fine.

Short-answer questions will never be conceptual, only related to configuration

1. 40 multiple choice questions worth 1.5 points each, total 60 points. There is
only one answer per question.
2. Short answer questions (40 points total)
  * Question 1 from chapter 11 (inter-VLAN routing)
    * Three methods: one interface per VLAN, router on a stick, virtual switch
    interface
  * Question 2 from chapter 15 (STP)
    * There will be a network, and we need to define a root bridge and find the
    root, forwarding, and blocking ports. Need to remember bridge id and least
    cost when prioritizing root port choice. The least path cost from current
    to root bridge is important. Only use the bridge id if there is a tie.
  * Question 3 from chapter 19 (multi-area OSPF)
    * Remember all the OSPF topology terminology and how to configure with
    commands
