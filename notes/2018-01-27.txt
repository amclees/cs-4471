Syllabus

There is a lab for this class, the time is arranged by students
The lab is in ECST C245

Final is at 9:30 (not university's time of 7)

The textbook is apparently very good

The 1 student with the highest number of absences gets a 0 in attendence, this sets the scale from absences of other students
In essence, attendance grades have their own curves
"1 leave early = 1 absent"

There will be a curve that guarantees that some students in this class will get an A

PowerPoints will be on CSNS


Hub
  Takes a frame and broadcasts it to all other ports
  When two devices send simultaneously, there is a collision
  Main used algorithm is CSMA/CD
  Unicast and broadcasts are heard by all other devices, but devices only handle broadcasts
  Half-duplex means ~monoplex, one sender at a time rather than full duplex
  In networks with hubs, switches and divide the network into segments which are their own collision domains
  Low bandwidth on hubs
Bridge
  A bridge is an antiquated version of a switch with 2 ports, it splits a network into 2 collision domains

Also covered router/switch

In class practice 1
  Initial - Router or switch work
  No, router creates broadcast domains rather than collision domains

Exam will have a similar figure to the slides and ask for the number of collision domains
  Ignore external networks
  Bridges always have 3 collision domains

In class practice 2
  1 Initial - C
  2 - C
  3 - B (Always one arrow for hub)
  4 - C (The question is phrased so C or E is right)
  5 - A
  6 - A
  7 - B
  8 - A
  9 - E
  10 - A C
