## Redundancy Continued

### Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)

HSRP defines a standby group

Each standby group has an active router, standby router(s), a virtual router,
and any other routers in the subnet

The problem with HSRP is that there is only ever one active router, making it
not very cost-effective

We can configure a virtual IP address and a virtual MAC address

The HSRP virtual MAC address starts with 00:00:0c (an ID assigned to Cisco)

07.ac is the HSRP protocol's ID

The last 8 bits are the HSRP group number, which is configurable

4 timers in HSRP

* Hello timer (timer before hello is sent)
* Hold timer (timer before active is considered offline)
* Active timer
* Standby timer

3 roles

* Virtual router - where packets are sent
* Active router - serves requests to the virtual router
* Standby router - stands by

To set as a standby router, use the commands:

```
# standby 1 ip <virtual router IP address>
# standby 1 name <name>
# standby 1 priority <priority>
```

To verify the commands worked, run `sh standby`.

## Network Address Translation (NAT)

Redundant concept deprecated by IPv6 that is still around because 128-bits are
too scary. Somehow, NAT is seen as less scary (though it should be feared more)

NAT runs on an internet-facing router that serves all traffic to and from the
network which is having its addresses translated. TCP and UDP ports are used
to map traffic to a particular host

Three types of NAT: static (one-to-one, no one uses it), dynamic (like static,
but juggles public addresses, no one uses it), PAT (everyone afraid of IPv6
uses it)

ICMP has a 16-bit identifier field used for ICMP PAT (IAT?). This parallels the size
of the TCP and UDP port fields

### Cisco Commands

#### Static  NAT

```
# ip nat inside source static <internal IP address> <external IP address>
```

There should be interfaces matching each of these addresses

#### Dynamic NAT

```
# ip nat pool <name> <external lower bound> <external higher bound> netmask <netmask>
# ip nat inside source list <ACL #> pool <name>
```

The second command here grants addresses matching ACL 1 IP addresses from the
pool

#### PAT

```
# ip nat pool <name> <external lower bound> <external upper bound>
# ip nat inside source list <ACL #> pool <name> overload
```

Just like dynamic NAT, but with `overload`

#### Show config

```
# sh ip nat translation
```

## IPv6

Why do we need NAT? The answer is "we don't, if we have IPv6."

2**32 is about 4 billion

2**128 is about 320 trillion trillion trillion

"Where is my shoes, right. It will come out"

Shoes and tables will be connected to the internet

NDN - Name data networking, no need for IP

Why do we need a new notation for IPv6?

`2001:db8::/32`

`32.1.219.128.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0/32`

When specifying ports, IPv6 addresses are surrounded in brackets

For example, the loopback address is `::1`. A local web server on port 3000
could be accessed with the URL `http://[::1]:3000`

### Address Types

For the final, the red highlighted sections of the slides must be known

#### Unicast

Normal packets

#### Global unicast addresses (`2000::/3`)

Typical publicly routable IP addresses

#### Link-local addresses (`fe80::/10`)

Private IP addresses (like `10.0.0.0/8` or others from IPv4)

#### Other

* Unique local addresses (`fc00::/7`)
* Multicast (`ff00::/8`)
* Anycast

### Cisco

Enable IPv6 on a router

```
(config) # ipv6 unicast-routing
```

On an interface, `ipv6 addr <prefix>/<prefix length>`. You can specify the
`eui-64` option to have the device use its MAC address for the interface id.
The MAC address is 48 bits, so it must be padded to be used (interface ids are
64 bits). When using EUI-64 the subnet identifier still must be specified.

#### Auto Configuration

Can be used to configure a host's IPv6 address

1. Learn prefix information from the router (subnet ID)
2. Append device's MAC address (interface ID)

The 7th bit in the IPv6 address must be set to 1 to specify it is a host's
address

`fffe` is used to pad MAC addresses to 64 bits (it is used to prefix the MAC
address)

This type of auto configuration is stateless because it doesn't make
external connections to receive further information

##### Step 1

The host sends a RS message (Router solicitation) which is ICMP type 133.
This is a multicast message

`ff02` is the prefix for multicast messages

##### Step 2

The router responses with a RA message (Router advertisement) which is ICMP
type 134

##### Cisco

Run `ipv6 address autoconfig` to listen for RAs then use EUI-64 to set the
IPv6 address

##### IPv6 header

* Version (4 bits) - always 6
* Class (8 bits), packet priority
* Flow label (20 bits) for SDN
* Payload length (16 bits)
* Next header (8 bits)
* Hop limit (8 bits) (TTL)
* Source address (128 bits)
* Destination address (128 bits)
