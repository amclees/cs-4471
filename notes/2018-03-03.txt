Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP)
  The next network project will require us to create our own network
  It is designed to collect information about devices attached locally to a device

  For example:
                     Switch
                       |
      LAN ---------- Router ----------- Router

      Always think about which areas in the topology are subnets/LANs

  The general term for a connected devices is called the next-hop

  In the Cisco console, run `sh cdp neighbors` to show information about neighboring devices
  Remember, Cisco likes to make their own commands. `sh` means show, not shell like it does everywhere else

DNS Setup
  Commands
    Be in command mode before executing the three commands

  Debug Commands
    ping
    traceroute
    debug (generic errors/routing info)
    sh processes (show processes, CPU utilization)


Chapter 8 - Managing Cisco Devices
  All Cisco routers have a 16-bit software register stored in NVRAM
  Start configuration is also in NVRAM
  The Cisco IOS is loaded from flash memory by default

  Changing the configuration register is sometimes necessary

  The default value is 0x2102 (0010 0001 0000 0010)

  Run `sh version` to see the value of the configuration register

  Turn on bit 6 to reset the password, this makes the router ignore the contents of the NVRAM
    0x2142 (0010 0001 0100 0010)

  The reset process requires interrupting the boot sequence of the router, then changing the configuration register. Following this by resetting the password, changing the register back, and writing the new startup-config to the NVRAM completes the password reset.

  Upgrading the Cisco IOS or restoring is also needed
    First, backup the IOS to a TFTP server
      The TFTP server needs to be hosted in the same subnet as the router's E0 interface
    Verify there is enough space in the flash memory with `sh flash`
    Run `copy tftp flash` to download the new IOS flash (the file uses the .bin extension)

  Cisco used to have different images for different sets of features
  Now there is only one universal image (v15+), but in order to be used features must be unlocked through the activation process

  Run `sh license udi` to get the Unique Device Identifier (UDI). It is the product ID and serial number together

  `license install flash:<FILENAME>.lic` is used to install the license
  You can try a feature for 60 days with an evaluation license (RTU right-to-use license)
  Run `license boot module` to enable RTU licenses
  `show license`, `show license feature`, `show license udi`, `show version`, `license install URL`, `license boot module`

Chapter 9 - IP Routing
  Routing basic
    Structure of a routing table -> maps destination to next hop
    Use longest prefix matching
  Run `sh ip route` to view the routing table on a router
    This command also summarizes the number of subnets and masks in use
  Remember bit, frame, datagram, segment, message for midterm

  3 routing methods covered:
    Static routing
    Default routing
    Dynamic routing
      AD is the Administrative Distance
      It is used to determine how much to trust advertised values

  RIP routing (Routing Information Protocol, proprietary by Cisco)
    Run `router rip`, then run the `network` command twice
