VLAN Configuration
  Two types of VLAN ports
    Trunk port (All VLANs)
    Access port (only one VLAN)

  Trunk ports are connected to a router
  Access ports are connected to a host

  The router has multiple virtual interfaces - one per VLAN
  A naming convention is fastethernet0/1.X where X is the VLAN ID

  Subnet description information
    IP address
    Subnet mask

  VLANs are subnets, so they are described using
    IP address
    Subnet mask
    VLAN ID

  The 'encapsulation' command in Cisco IOS allows creation of subinterfaces on a router

  So far we focuses on router on a stick

  The is also Switch Virtual Interface (SVI)

  Use `ip routing` to enable SVI on a switch to allow VLAN configuration


Enhanced Switching
  Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP)
    Designed to prevent loops in a layer 2 network by enforcing a tree-like structure
    STP develops a database of topology, the creates a tree
    The tree is then used by all switches when sending frames

    Root Switch
      Switch with the lowest (and best) switch id
    Switch ID
      Compound of switch priority (32768 default) and MAC address (base not port)
    BPDU (Switch Protocol Data Unit)
      A type of frame with STP information
      Three types
        Config BPDU for initial provision of information
        TCN - Topology Change Notification
        TCA - Topology Change ACK

    Port roles
      Root port (The root port is the link the the lowest cost to the root switch)
      Designated port (The port STP designates to be used because it is a part of the tree)
      Forwarding port (Either a root port or designated port)
      Blocked port (A blocked port is excluded from the tree to prevent loops)

    Convergence
      Convergence does not refer to the process, rather,
      it refers to the time after the protocol has converged

      Once all ports are either Forwarding or Blocked ports, then convergence has occurred
      No host data is transmitted while STP is converging

    Link Cost (On final exam)
      Port cost is the cost of a link
      Path cost is the sum of all port costs to the root switch
      Cost values
      Bandwidth     | Cost
      10 Mb/s     | 100
      100 Mb/s    | 19
      1000 Mb/s   | 4
      10,000 Mb/s | 2

    All ports in the root switch are forwarding ports 
      They could not be root
      The root of a tree cannot cut branches without breaking connections to hosts)

    Algorithm (Will be a short-answer question on final exam)
      Determine root switch based on switch id
        Minimum switch ID (priority . MAC address)
      Identify port types

    Variants (On exam)
      IEEE 802.1d - original standard, also called Common Spanning Tree (CST)
        Very slow, does not account for costs
        Primarily a solution to layer 2 loops
      PVST+ - Cisco proprietary enhancement with seperate 802.1d STP instance for each VLAN
        Still takes time, but there are multiple root switchs
        Has a special unique switch ID
          Switch priority . sys-id-ext . MAC address
      RSTP - Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol
        Faster than CST and PVST+
        On the exam we may need to calculate the path cost for use in determining root switch
        In RSTP - consider path cost, then consider switch id
        Port priority (default 32) may be set to override cost
        If everything else ties, the port with the lowest interface number is chosen
          Should not ever happen
