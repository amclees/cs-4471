# Layer 1/2 WAN Continued and Intelligent Networks

## High-Level Data-Link Control (HDLC) Protocol

* Popular ISO-standard, bit-oriented layer 1 protocol
* Cisco-proprietary
* Used on serial links

### Commands

* Go to a serial interface
* Configure IP address as normal
* `no shutdown`
* On Cisco routers, HDLC is automatically enabled for serial interfaces

## Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)

* Dial-up: asynchronous serial
* ISDN: synchronous serial

PPP is a protocol to use if devices are not Cisco and therefore cannot use HDLC

### Three phases

1. Link establishment
2. Authentication phase (optional)
3. Link layer protocol phase

### Configuring PPP Authentication

* From interface config shell:
  * `encapsulation ppp` to enable PPP
  * `hostname <own name>`
  * `username <other router's hostname> password <password>`
  * `ppp authentication chap ppp`

CHAP stands for Challenge Handshake Authentication protocol

PAP stands for Password Authentication Protocol

## Architecture

HDLC sits above physical layer in a way (technically OS level 2)

It encapsulates layer 2 frames

## Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

* One type is eBGP which connects a WAN to external networks
* To configure, some information is needed
  * AS numbers for self and all remotes
  * All neighbor IP addresses
  * Networks that must be advertised

### Commands

* `router bgp <as number>` to turn on BGP and set own AS number
* `neighbor <neighbor ip address> remote-as <as number>` to add neighbors
* `network <local network ip address> mask <local network subnet mask>` to add
internal networks to broadcast

A router may only be in one AS at any given time

Use `sh ip bgp ?` to get the various diagnostic commands

## Intelligent Networks

Typical switch topology has some prooblems:

* Management required
* STP blocks half of all uplinks
* Switches do not directly communicate

For these reasons switch stacking may be used

Cisco StackWise connects switches on a rack to act as one larger switch

## Cloud Computing

Cisco needed buzzwords in their textbook which was written when cloud computing
was still a buzzword

## Software Defined Networking (SDN)

Integrates an application with routing to improve overall network performance
and stability

Cisco's SDN controller is called APIC-EM. It sits above OpenFlow in the SDN
stack

## Intelligent WAN (IWAN)

Another proprietary Cisco protocol

Can dynamically route based on info from application servers

## Quality of Service (QoS)

Prioritizes different kinds of network traffic

Variation in packet delay during a video stream can cause a kind of packet loss
where the packet arrives, but it is not at the right time. This means the packet
is useless and must be dropped although it did arrive

Low Latency Queue (LLQ) packets are always sent first

Congestion Avoidance starts dropping packets before the queue fails

For example, a highway can avoid congestion by dropping cars (into a pit below
where cars are then scrapped)

Cisco uses Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED) to limit packet loss
