# IPv6 protocols continued and EIGRP

## DHCPv6

DHCPv6 is used to dynamically assign IPv6 addresses

RS - router solicitation

RA - router advertisement

```
|---------------------|---------------|
        Subnet          interface ID
```

The interface ID is the device MAC

## ICMPv6

Part of IPv6, operating at layer 3, included in IPv6 packets

ICMPv6 is identified by the value 58 in the IPv6 header field

From RFC 4443:

```
       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      +                         Message Body                          +
      |                                                               |
```


## Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP)

In IPv4, there was only one default gateway

### NS, NA vs RS, RA

NS and NA are for transferring host info (Check for duplicate IP addresses)

RS and RA are for transferring router info (finding the default gateway)

### Duplicate Address Detection (DAD)

To prevent 2 hosts from randomly selecting the same address, DAD is performed
and any duplicate addresses are regenerated)

## Quiz

IPv4 header size - 20 bytes

In final exam, IPv6 header size will be there (40 bytes)

## Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)

Another proprietary Cisco protocol

An internet is a network of networks

Each router in a WAN could be connected to a LAN

Dijkstra's algorithm and distance vector algorithms may be used for routing in
a WAN.

If all the hundreds of millions of routers run the same routing algorithm, the
overhead for handling routing information becomes very large

VLSM implies a classless network, lack thereof implies a classful network

EIGRP is a classless distance-vector protocol used among a group of routers
running the same routing protocol

It is sometimes called a hybrid protocol because it incorporates elements of a
link-state routing protocol

There are two timers:

* Hello timer (send hello packets every X seconds)
* Hold timer (wait X seconds before assuming other router is dead)

AS numbers must match during neighbor discovery

Metrics must be equal (K values). The metric is a composite of bandwidth, load
total delay, reliability, and hop count. The formula for the metric is rather
lengthy

The only time EIGRP advertises all information is when it discovers a new
neighbor

### Advertised Distance (AD)

Minimum of all distances received from other routers

### Feasible distance (FD)

Minimum of all received distances from other routers + distance to the router
that broadcasted the minimum

### EIGRP tables

* Neighbor table (adjacent neighbor information)
* Topology table (designation of successors and feasible successors)
* Routing table (where to route packets by destination)

The Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) is used to calculate the best route
without loops

Successor routes have paths copied to the routing table; feasible successor
routes do not

### Packet types

* Update (route information, reliable multicast for changes, if only one router
needs an update uses unicast)
* Query (request for specific route info)
* Reply (response to query)
* Hello (unreliable multicast (no ACK))
* ACK (response to update)

### DUAL

Used for selecting and maintaining the best paths in EIGRP

* Determines backup routes
* Supports VLSMs
* Performs route recoveries
* Queries for unknown routes
* Queries for alternate routes

### IOS Commands

In config mode:

```
(config) # router eigrp <AS number>
# For each network
(config-router) # network <network IP address> <network wildcard>
```

The network command uses wildcard addresses

`no auto-summary` will stop the router from advertising everywhere which is
important for discontiguous networks

### Route selection

Selects the best FD
