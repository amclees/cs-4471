# EIGRP Continued and OSPF

## EIGRP continued

### Split Horizon

If a route update is received on an interface, the route will not be advertised
on the interface where it was received

Final exam will not cover troubleshooting EIGRP problems

### Configuration

In config mode:

`ipv6 router eigrp <AS number>` will enable EIGRPv6 and open EIGRP config

`no shutdown` starts EIGRP

`router-id <id>` sets the router ID

`ipv6 eigrp 10` on each interface enables EIGRPv6 for the interface

## Open short path first (OSPF)

ASBR (Autonomous system border router)
ABR (Area border router)

There are multiple areas in an AS, each with an ABR

The whole AS has one ASBR

Neighbors are 2 or more routers with an interface on the same network

A link is a network or interface assigned to a network

A router ID (RID) is an IP address identifying each router

Not all neighbors are considered adjacent

Designated router (DR) - A router elected whenever routers are connected to the
same broadcast network

Link state advertisement (LSA) is a packet containing link-state and routing
information shared among OSPF routers

An OSPF area is a grouping of network and routers with an area ID, which is
associated with router interfaces. A router can be part of multiple areas. All
routers in an area are **contiguous**.

The main purpose of OSPF is to select the route for a packet

It has 3 parts:

* Neighbor and adjacency initialization
* LSA - Link state advertisement
* SPF tree calculation

224.0.0.5 is the IP address for point-to-point networks

The calculation of the SPF tree is done with Dijkstra's algorithm

RFC 2338 defines how the costs in the tree are defined

### Configuration of OSPF

In config mode, run `router ospf <OSPF process ID`. The ID is 1-65535

This opens router config mode

`network <network IP> <wildcard> area <area ID>` will set up a network

`no router rip` is needed to disable RIP

`passive-interface <interface ID>` from router config mode will prevent OSPF
from using an interface

`sh ip <ospf>` and its subcommands display OSPF config info

`sh ip protocols` lists all running protocols, which can be useful

### Single-area network problems

Scalability - flooding the entire network with link-state information is not
practical

### Router roles

ASBR - inter-AS router, separates OSPF instances

ABR - inter-area router, separates LSA flooding domains

Backbone router - router in area 0, connects all AS areas

Internal routers - router with all interfaces in the same area

### LSA

5 types:

1. Router link advertisement (RLA)
  * Sent by every router in an area to each other router in the area
2. Network link advertisement (NLA)
  * Generated by DR
3. Summary link advertisement (SLA)
  * Advertise inter-area routes
4. ASBR summary advertisement
5. Autonomous system advertisement
