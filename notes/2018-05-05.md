# OSPF Continued and WANs

## OSPF

### Neighbor States

#### DOWN

No Hello packets received

#### ATTEMPT

Only happens for NBMA (non-broadcast multiaccess connections), neighbors must
be configured manually

#### INIT

Hello received but their is no router ID for the receiving router

#### 2WAY

Hello received with router IDs for both routers

#### EXSTART

* Exchange DR and BDR information

#### EXCHANGE

* Exchange LSDB summaries
* Exchange LSAck

#### LOADING

* Request LSA info
* Receive LSA info
* LSAck for that info

#### FULL

* All information exchange complete
* OSPF Routing starts once this state is reached

### Commands

* `router ospf <ospf process id>` turns on OSPF
* `router-id <id>` where ID is the OSPF router id
* `network <ip> <wildcard> area <area number>` to set a network area
* `clear ip ospf process` to reload OSPF router id from config

### IP SLA

IP service level agreement

Run `ip sla 1` to start it; it allows for network and performance monitoring

### DTP

* Dynamic trunking protocol
* `sh dtp interface <int>` to show DTP config
* DTP is a Cisco protocol for VLAN dynamic mode
* `switchport mode dynamic` makes a switch port use DTP

## WANs

Demarcation (demarc) is where the service provider's responsibility ends

The central office (CO) connects a customer to a providers switching network

A toll network is a trunk line owned by the ISP

Three types of connections:

* Synchronous serial
* Asynchronous serial (ISDN) for circuit-switched networks (televisionとか)
* Synchronous serial for packet-switched networks

DOCSIS - Data over cable service interface specification

DSL - Digital subscriber line

All types of DSL are layer 1 technologies

ADSL was developed for higher download bandwidth than upload bandwidth
